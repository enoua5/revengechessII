  // ***NOTE***
  // `use_ssl` goes unused in this file, because the TLS ended up being a different build

  // If set to false, server will use ws://, with no SSL
  // Any players joining over https:// will be unable to join
  // Setting to true will change the protocol to wss:// with SSL
  // And all players will be able to join
  // However, that requires setting up certificates!

  // this can easily be generated using `openssl dhparam -out dh.pem 2048`
  // This option is ignored if `use_ssl` is set to false
  // "temp_dh_file": "dh.pem",
  // Path to a certificate chain file
  // A basic self-signed one can be created with this command,
  // but you'll need an actual CA for for real players to join:
  // openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out chain.crt
  // This option is ignored if `use_ssl` is set to false
  // "cert_chain_file":"chain.crt",
  // Path to the private key
  // Generated by the same above command
  // Also only used if `use_ssl` is true
  // "private_key": "private.key"
